I am a Mathematics and Computer Science student based in Montreal, Canada.

I am interested in both the theoretical aspects of Computer Science, e.g., Machine Learning, Theory of Complexity, Design and Analysis of Algorithms
and the practical aspects, e.g., Software Design and Programming Paradigms.
