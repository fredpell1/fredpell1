I recently graduated Magna cum laude from an honours Math and CS degree from Concordia University in Montreal, Canada. 

I am interested in both the theoretical aspects of Computer Science, e.g., Machine Learning, Theory of Complexity, Design and Analysis of Algorithms
and the practical aspects like Software Design, Programming Languages, and Programming Paradigms.
